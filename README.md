Hi, brothers of VCCIV! This is basic MATLAB code of Velodyne in KUAFU-1st, Xi'an Jiaotong University.

This repository is very benefical to beginners of 3D LiDAR, which includes data manipulating (split RawBinaryData.txt into pieces, convert binary file binary_xxx.txt to well-known 3D point cloud format) and pose analyzing (global pose and local pose).
